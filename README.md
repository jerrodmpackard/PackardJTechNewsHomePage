// Peer Review: Site looks pretty dang good. Obviously try to fix the spacing between the button and the dark container. If you can figure out the width of the side drawer with bootstrap that would be cool also. I noticed on desktop mode the "The Bright Future of Web 3.0?" line doesn't wrap the same was as the prototype. The Read more button I think is slightly more narrow then what you have it. 
Overall decent job dude. I wouldn't spend too much time on the fixes because this assignment is stupid
